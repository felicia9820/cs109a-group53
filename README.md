# Brazilâ€™s COVID Response

### Group 53: Isheka Agarwal, Harkirat Bhullar, Felicia Roman, and Alex Zhou

Countless lives have been affected globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leading many countries to take drastic measures to control the spread of the virus. Some major policies implemented  include (1) early lockdown as practiced in India, (2) late lockdown as practiced in Italy, and (3) close contact tracing, as practiced in South Korea. Surprisingly, despite being one of the hardest-hit countries by the pandemic, Brazil has yet to implement any significant measures against coronavirus. 

This leads us to ask the question: which strategy, or combination of strategies, between the three listed is the most effective for containing COVID-19 in general and for Brazil?

This repository contains the following:
1. brazil_covid_response_final.ipynb: The ipython notebook used for preprocessing, EDA, baseline models (polynomial regression), and time series models. 
2. Data: this folder includes all of our data used for visualizations and modeling. There was one data file which was too large to upload on Github. 
3. Final_Report.pdf: our written report where we discuss our reasonings behind the chosen models, findings, conclusions and impact statement.
